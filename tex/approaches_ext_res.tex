\section{Approaches to incorporate WordNet information}
Having the dataset of the previous section, we next try to improve our latest re-implementation Residual-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\dagger$} using WordNet. 
\subsection{Methods}
Unlike \ac{KIM}, which has shown an intuitive and successful strategy of incorporating WordNet into a neural network, the Residual-Stacked Encoder does not use inter-sentence attention. Without changing this, we therefore cannot likewise align words of $p$ with words of $h$ to identify their WordNet relation. We intend to leave the model with the plain sentence-encoding architecture, targeting the incorporation of external resources for general sentence representations thus by encoding each sentence individually \citep{nangia2017repeval}. Naturally, not being able to align words with each other poses a new difficulty, since the relations of WordNet are defined between two senses. Subsequentially, we apply other strategies, than directly encoding the relation of two words (or senses), explained below.
\subsubsection{Drawbacks of using insights of max-pooled sentence representations}
In Section ยง\ref{sec:understanding} we gained valid insights on the sentence representations and showed that these sucessfully can be used to change the meaning of sentence representations. Following these conclusions, a possible strategy is, to train the model in a way, that antonyms or co-hyponyms result in distinct high dimensions within the sentence representation, synonyms having the same high values and hypernyms a subset of hyponyms. Knowing reasonable values for each values within the dimensions, this could be broken down to a simple regression problem. Since we did not find an elegant way to naturally include this into the loss function, two possibilities exist:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Manually define the $\xi$ of dimensions:} The values for each word are defined before the training, w.r.t. the lexical relations that are shared amongst them, using automatic optimization techniques. The loss is defined w.r.t. those defined values for each word within a sentence.
\item \textbf{Regularily analyse the $\xi$ of dimensions:} Instead of defining the $\xi$ of each dimension beforehand, it can be gained by an anaylse step, similar to the one conducted for this work, every iteration. Knowing the dimensions, how they are already used by the model, they can slightly be adapted such that our wanted criteria is met. For instance, let the words $w_1$ and $w_2$ share a common close hypernym, thus both are co-hyponyms. After identifying the dimensions, that result in a high value coming from both words, some of tose dimensions are reserved for $w_1$ only, while others are reserved for $w_2$ only. This may also be achieved automatically, if dimensions are analysed for their high-valued words w.r.t. WordNet relations.
\end{itemize}
Both approaches severely lack the possibility of encoding words depending on their context into the sentence representation. While we gained some insights on the sentence-representations, it is insufficient to define them in a reasonable way. Even if this would be possible, it is not desired. Both strategies, especially the first, highly resemble traditional feature-engineering. Since the automatic feature selection is one of the key strengths of neural models \citep{bengio2013representation}, those strategies would rather be similar to a step backward than forward. Instead we identify to potential strategies, that are simpler to implement and would result in a broader applicability, not being tied to max-pooled sentence representations.

\subsubsection{Fuse WordNet information within the embedding-layer}
Additional information within the word-representations has the high advantage, of being very gerneral applicable. Following \cite{ruckle2018concatenated} we do not use exclusively retrained or adjusted word-embeddings. Instead, for each word $w$ we lookup the according word-vector within the original distributed GloVe embeddings and concatenate it with the corresponding word-vector of the same $w$ from the additional word-embeddings. If no corresponding vector for $w$ is present within those, we concatenate an zero-valued vector of the same dimensionality. Doing so, we do not chnge the original information of distributed word-embeddings such that the model may still rely on the same features, if they are useful. Even though some of the newly introduced might be redundant w.r.t. the orignal GloVe embeddings, some contain additional information, that the network can use to differentiate between words, that are highly similar in GloVe but mutually exclusive. Additional to doing this experiment with the mono-lingual attract-repel vectors, provided by \cite{ruckle2018concatenated}, we use two different word-vecor sources.

\paragraph*{Overfitting WordNet}
We apply a simple method to create addtitional word vectors $v$ that are similar for the words $w_1$ and $w_2$, if they are synonyms within WordNet, and different if $w_1$ and $w_2$ are antonyms or co-hyponyms. For this we extract samples ($w_1$, $w_2$, \texttt{relation}), whereas $w_1$ and $w_2$ are lemmas, that are linked via \texttt{relation} within WordNet, represented by their original GloVe embeddings. Using a two layer \ac{MLP}, we map each word-vector $w \in \mathbb{R}^{300}$ to $v \in \mathbb{R}^{20}$. In our last layer we apply tangens-hyperbolicus as non-linearity, to squeeze all values $v^i$ within $v$, with $v^i$ being the $i$th value within $v$, are in an appropriate range:  $ \forall i: [i \in \{x \in \mathbb{N} | x < 20\} \Rightarrow v^i \in \{x \in \mathbb{R} | -1 < x < 1\}]$. Let $w \in \mathbb{R}^{300 \times 1}$ be the original word-embedding, $W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{100 \times 300}$ and $b_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{100 \times 1}$ the weight matrix and bias of the first layer, and $W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{20 \times 100}$ and $b_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{20 \times 1}$ of the second layer respectively. The new word-vector $v$ is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
v = \tanh(W_2 \text{ reLU}(W_1w + b_1) + b_2)
\end{equation}
We optimize the representations $v_1$ and $v_2$, coming from ($w_1$, $w_2$, \texttt{relation}) using \ac{MSE} with the Eucledian Distance, which should be high, if the relation indicates, $w_1$ and $w_2$ are mutually exclusive, and low, if both are synonyms. Thus, we define $\theta=0$ for synonyms, and $\theta =10$, for antonyms and co-hyponyms rspectively (we bound the difference to $\frac{|v|}{2}$, with $|v|$ being the amount of dimensions of the new word-vectors, as it creates sufficiently distinct vectors):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:loss_embd}
\text{loss} = \frac{1}{2}\Bigg( \sqrt{\sum^{20}_{i=1}(v^i_1 - v^i_2)^2} - \theta\Bigg)^2
\end{equation}
We overfit on the lexical relations, extracted from WordNet, using the loss function in Equation (\ref{eq:loss_embd}), intending to memorize whether two words are compatible or not. This optimization process also updates the GloVe embeddings of $w$ during training. In order to create word-vectors that specifically focus on either antonymy or co-hyponomy, we train embeddings for each of those relations individually, both times together with synonyms in order to have a counterpart. Embeddings differentiating between synonyms and antonyms are referred to as \texttt{Trained-Syn-Ant}, differentiation between synonyms and co-hyponyms as \texttt{Trained-Syn-Cohyp}. We refer to the concatenation of both embeddings as \texttt{Trained-Syn-Cohyp-Ant}. Since the Eucledian Distance is a symmetric measure we cannot include the hypernym-hyponym relation into those embeddings, due to their asymmetry. We thus train other embeddings differentiation between all relevant lexical semantic relations\footnote{Synonymy, Antonomy, Hypernyomy, Co-hyponomy} in the same manner, but with 50 instead of 20 dimensions. In order to enable the network to deal with asymmetric relations (and thus is able to predict that a $w_1$ is a hypernym of $w_2$, whereas $w_2$ is a hyponym of $w_1$) we apply a softmax layer and train the network with cross-entropy loss, prediction the actual relation, holding between $w_1$ as the first input and $w_2$ as the second input. We refer to those embeddings as \texttt{Trained-All}.
\paragraph*{Adding categorical information}
Alternatively, especially targeting the detection of co-hyponyms, instead of concatenating different embeddings, we conctatenate each word $w$ with the distributed GloVe vector of the hypernyms of each $w$. The motivation is, that the network is able to identify, that two words share the same hypernym and hence, learning more subtle differences within the actual value-differences within both word-vectors. Due to WordNet's fine-grained ontology, we apply different strategies of taking the mean vector of one up to five hypernomys of a word. If hypernyms within WordNet consist of multi-word expressions, we take the word-embedding of the last word. For instance for ``single-reed instrument'', being the first hypernym of ``saxophone'', we concatenate the word-vector of ``saxophone'' with the word vector of ``instrument''. We refer to those embeddings as \texttt{Hypernyms-<amount-of-hypernyms>}.
\subsubsection{Fuse WordNet information within the sentence-representations}\label{sec:mt_learning_intro}
It is very known, that neural networks do well in learning relevant features \citep{bengio2013representation}, however, as seen in Section ยง\ref{sec:additional_snli_set} and shown by \cite{gururangan2018annotation}, those features do not necessarily correspond with \ac{NLU}, but are heavily biased by dataset-specific patterns. These are not reduced, if we add additional informtion to the embeddings, thus we still need to rely on the full model to pick up on good features, yielding to correct decisions for the \textit{right} reason. \cite{gulccehre2016knowledge} show on a very different task, of detecting pentomino shapes, that deep neural networks may not even find the most useful features and can heavily leverage from human guidance when creating intermediate representations. In their very simple toy-scenario, this could be done by manually creating intermediate target representations, which is not easily possible for sentence-representations in \ac{NLP}. We thus continue training the nural network in an end-to-end manner. In order to guide the network in learning more useful sentence-representations, we create a second task, namely the helper-task, sharing some basic components with the maintask (predict the label for \ac{NLI}). Thus, both tasks rely on the same sentence representation, that will therefore encode relevant features for both tasks, whereas one can leverage from the features from the other. This is commonly known as multitask-learning and has shown to be successful to improve the generalization of shared representations \citep{nangia2017repeval}.
\paragraph*{Multitask architecture}
The multitask setup is visualized in Figure \ref{fig:mt_architecture}.
\begin{figure}[tph!]
\centering
	\includegraphics[totalheight=5.5cm]{fig/mt_architecture.png}
	\caption{Architecture of the Residual-Stacked Encoder with multitask learning for the sentence-representations.}
	\label{fig:mt_architecture}
\end{figure}
The left side shows the standard architecture of the Residual-Stacked Encoder, as defined in Section ยง\ref{sec:residual_encoder_def} Both sentences $p$ and $h$ are encoded using the same sentence encoder. The resulting sentence representations are concatenated with the additional features and classified by the final \ac{MLP} into on the three labels entailment, neutral or contradiction.The additonal \ac{MLP} on the right side is used for the helper task. We create the helper-task with the intention to force the model to encode differences between two words $w_1$ and $w_2$, if one is the antonym or co-hyponym of the other, into the sentence representations, as this essentially is used for the final prediction.  Likewise, if $w_1$ and $w_2$ are synonyms or $w_2$ is the hypernym of $w_1$ and thus entailed by it, we want this information to be encoded as well. In order to contain this information, which preumeably helps the generalization power of the main-task, within the sentence representation, we define our helper task, as a binary classification problem, whether a word is encoded within the sentence representation or not. For this, we consider both sentences $p$ and $h$ from a \ac{BoW} perspective. Let $S=\{w^0, w^1 , \ldots, w^{n-1}, w^n\}$ be the set of all $n$ distinct words $w$ within a sentence. We apply the same task for $p$ and $h$. Since we do not consider them simultaneously but individually, we define the helper-task using the general $S$ respectively for both. For each $w^i \in S$, we identify words from WordNet, being related to $w^i$ with one of the previously mentioned lexical semantic relations. Let $A$ be the set of words, who's meaning must be entailed by the sentence representation, thus $A$ contains all hypernyms and synonyms of all $w^i \in S$. Similarily, let $B$ be the set of words, who's meaning is \textit{not} entailed by the sentence, thus antonyms and co-hyponyms of all $w^i \in S$. Additionally, all $w^i$ that have related words via lexical semantic relations are also added to $A$. A sentence like ``People are watching a soccer game between Brazil and Mexico.'' may still cause conflicts, as $A$ contains ``Brazil'' and ``Mexico'', however they may also be present within $B$, being mutual co-hyponyms. To avoid conflicts, if several co-hyponyms are present within the same sentence, we ensure that $A$ and $B$ are not overlapping, by setting $B = B \setminus (S \cup A)$. The final helper-task takes a sentence representation $r$ and a word embedding $e$ as input, and must classify, whether $e$ belongs to $A$ or $B$, meaning whether $e$ is present (in the sense of entailment) within $r$ or not. Since the same embeddings are used and fine-tuned, this may also be seen similarily to further postprocess word vectors, like in Attract-Repel \citep{vulic2017specialising}, but additionally ensuring, those differences are propagated into the sentence representation. 

\paragraph*{Training}
The main-task and the helper-task are simultaneously trained. Thus, the combined loss, denoted as $loss_\text{combined}$, aggregating the loss for the main-task, denoted as $loss_\text{main}$, and for the helper task, denoted as $loss_\text{helper}$, as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:multitask_aggregate}
\text{loss}_\text{combined} = \alpha \text{ loss}_\text{main} + (1 - \alpha)\text{ loss}_\text{helper}
\end{equation}
whereas $\alpha \in \{x \in \mathbb{R} | 0 \leq x \leq 1\}$ regulates the impact of the main-task, with a high value ($\alpha = 1$) only considering the main-task and a low value ($\alpha = 0$) only the helper-task. We train the network using a batchsize of 32. While $loss_\text{main}$ remains the original mean cross-entropy, $loss_\text{helper}$ is also based on mean cross-entropy, yet is down-weighted for the following reason. Let $A_p$, $B_p$ and $A_h$, $B_h$ be $A$ and $B$ according to the definitions above for $p$ and $h$ respectively and $|A|$ denote the amount of samples within a set $A$. One can safely assume, that the amount of samples for the helper-task is tremendously higher than for the main task, as one single sample ($p$,$h$) here yields $|A_p|+|B_p|+|A_h|+|B_h| \gg 1$ samples in the helper-task. Let $b$ be the batch-size and $p^i$ and $h^i$ denote the $i$th $p$ or $h$ within a minibatch. We calculate $n$ to be the total amount of samples for the helper-task within a given batch:
\begin{equation}
n = \sum^b_{i=1}\Big(|A_{p^i}|+|B_{p^i}|+|A_{h^i}|+|B_{h^i}|\Big)
\end{equation}
Let $loss_\text{s}$ be the loss, calculated with mean cross-entropy, for all samples coming from $A_s$, $B_s$, with $s$ being any sentence $p$ or $h$. The re-weigted $loss_\text{helper}$ over all ($p$, $h$) within a minibatch is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
\text{loss}_\text{helper} = \sum^b_{i=1}\bigg( \frac{|A_{p^i}| + |B_{p^i}|}{n} \text{loss}_{\text{p}^i} + \frac{|A_{h^i}| + |B_{h^i}|}{n} \text{loss}_{\text{h}^i} \bigg)
\end{equation}
To reduce training time, we always train the samples for the helper-task and main-task, based on the same source sentences, within the same batch (as opposed to iterate between both tasks), keeping the frequency of the cost-intensive sentence-encoding step to a minimum.

\paragraph*{Multitask variations}
We evaluate several implementations with small differences or changed hyperparameters, following the presented architecture. Those are described below, mostly differing in their impact on the sentence-representation. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Size and amount of layers:} We evaluate different sizes of the helper-task \ac{MLP}. Naturally, the simpler the helper network (fewer layers and dimensions per layer), the more relevant information must be encoded within the representation. This should be preferrable, since finally we aim for the main-task to identify the same, hopefully meaningful, features, and we do not have further usage for the logic, implemented within the helper-task \ac{MLP}.
\item  \textbf{Dropout:} Similarily, by using dropout in the helper-task, we motivate the creation of redundant features within the sentence-representation, by applying dropout to the helper-task (0.1).
\item \textbf{Re-sample less frequent label:} We observe that usually $|A_s| < |B_s|$, resulting especially from the large amount of co-hyponyms. In order to prevent the helper task to take the label distribution into account rather than creating relevant features, we re-sample the less frequent class of $A_s$ or $B_s$, such that $|A_s| = |B_s|$.
\item \textbf{Reweighting tasks:} By either statically adapting the value of $\alpha$ beforehand, or dynamically updating it during training, we change the impact of each task. Specifically, we enable in the \texttt{finetune}\footnote{$\alpha$ for 10 iterations: $\alpha = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]$} setting, to only optimize the performance on \ac{SNLI} after initially focusing on both tasks equally. In the setting \texttt{focus-start}\footnote{$\alpha$ for 10 iterations: $\alpha = [0.0, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0]$}, the encoder focuses on the helper task in within the first iterations. Only after the sentence representation is useful for the helper task, the main task is also considered. As opposed to that, in \texttt{focus-mid}\footnote{$\alpha$ for 10 iterations: $\alpha = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]$}, we first tune the sentence-representation only for \ac{SNLI}, adapt this useful representation then for the helper task and finally finetune to \ac{SNLI} again.
\item \textbf{Freeze helper-task weights:} To not encode too much logic in the helper \ac{MLP}, we freeze the weights after one iteration, dentoted as \texttt{(freeze)}, assuming this is sufficient to have a reasonable weight matrix learned. Subsequent enhancements must afterwards be encoded directly in the sentence representation. 
\item \textbf{Additional weight matrix on top of sentence-encoder:} In order to achieve a strong accuracy for the helper task, more than one layer is required in the \ac{MLP}. To reduce the impact of the unused layers, we use a two layer \ac{MLP} for the helper task, the main task however  does not dpeend on the original sentence-representation anymore, but from the output of the first layer of the helper-task \ac{MLP}. We name this configuration \texttt{(shared)} in the evaluation.
\item \textbf{Focus on responsible words:} Instead of using all values, encoded within the sentence-representation, we follow the same approach as described in Section ยง\ref{sec:understanding}, identifying which word is responsible for which dimension, and focus the network on those explicit dimensions. Thus, we consider the original pairs ($w_1$, $w_2$, \texttt{relation}) and set all dimensions within the sentence-representation to zero, if they do not arise from $w_1$. Subsequent steps remain unchanged. This is motivated by the high amount of noise, especially for samples within $B$. Hence, the helper-task, that should focus on the relation between $w_1$ and $w_2$, may not depend on dimensions of $w_1$ in the sentence representation, but on arbitrary other dimensions. For this particular case we do leave $B$ untouched (and do not calculate it as $B  = B \setminus (S \cup A)$), since the conflict is resolved by focusing on different parts of the sentence-representation. We refer to \texttt{(max-pool)}, wen applying this strategy.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Extraction of WordNet data}
We experiment with different strategies how to extract relevant data from WordNet, considering the lexical semantic relations, as described in Section ยง\ref{sec:word_relations}, as relevant. We find, that by aiming for a high recall, thus considering \textit{all} senses of each word, a lot of noise is added, especially for co-hyponyms. For instance consider the word ``blue'', which is in almost all cases mutually exclusive to other colors like ``red'', ``green'' or ``yellow'', thus we intend to find these colors. While this can be extracted within the first synset, blue contains 16 different senses, ranging from ``sky'', `` amobarbital sodium'' or a ``family of butterflies'' to adjectives like ``aristrocratic'' or ``depressed'', yielding in antonyms of ``blue'' like  ``lowborn'', ``cheerful'' or even ``clean'' and synonyms as according to oher words for each sense. The impact is even stronger, when identifying co-hyponyms. As seen in Section ยง\ref{sec:wordnet}, WordNet maintains in many, but not in all cases, a very fine-grained hypernomy graph, requiring us to not only consider the next hypernym, but several hypernyms along the path. Doing so, words like ``miller'' (a type of a moth) are considered as co-hyponym, naturally in an increasing frequency, as co-hyponyms in a tree-like structure appear exorbitantly more often than antonyms or synonyms.

\subsubsection{Strategy to extract data}\label{sec:used_wordnet_extract_strategy}
Instead of the previously explained approach, we only consider the first synset of each word and detect related synsets via the lexical relations. This does not remove noise, yet reduces it tremendeously, at the cost of neglecting several useful lexical semantic relations, or even using the majorily wrong sense\footnote{In Section ยง\ref{sec:wordnet} we showed that table (in the sense of a tabular visualization) is the first sense of table (as opposed to the sense of a furniture). Yet, in \ac{SNLI} we especially expect the second sense to be useful.}. The main motivation is, that we lack of automatic evaluation emthods for different types of extracted data w.r.t. \ac{SNLI}, conflicting with the time constraints for the remainder of the work. Since previous experiments\footnote{Conducted by Vered Shwartz and not part of this work.} focused on a high recall and did not improve the performance, we go in the opposite dirtection, aiming for a high precision of the extracted data. Note, that the WordNet baseline, as defined in Section ยง\ref{sec:additional_snli_set} did not suffer from the same problem, since all word-pairs ($w_p$, $w_h$) already are known to have a meaningful relation (based on their creation process), thus the extracted relation between both words most likely is valid. The problem only occurs, as we intend to extract words the other way around, by knowing the relation and finding appropriate words.

\subsubsection{Final extracted data}
Specifically, by only looking at the first senses of each word $w$, we consider all lemmata within the synset as synonyms of $w$. Hypernyms of $w$ are considered up to an edge length of 5. For co-hyponyms, we consider all hyponyms of hypernyms of $w$, both bound to an edge length of three, if and only if they are not also a hypernym of $w$.

\label{tab:examples_extracted_wn}
\end{table}
We also consider \textit{part-meronyms}, of synsets, that are any kind of hyponym of ``location''. Since the interpretation of meronyms is not trivial w.r.t. entailment, we thus only consider it in the context of locations and assume that a meronym entails its holonym\footnote{As in ``John is in Berlin.'' $\Rightarrow$ ``John is in Germany.'', with ``Berling'' \textit{part-of} ``Germany''}. Using the explained extraction method, we generate a total of 686,265 word pairs with their entailment interpretation into either $A$ or $B$, precisely $|A|=104,550$ and $|B|=581,715$. Note that these include the word itself like ($w_1$,$w_1$, $A$), if lexical semantic relations for a word are found. All words appear within the \ac{SNLI} dataset and thus can be useful. We show a random samples of ten pairs for each class respectively in Table \ref{tab:examples_extracted_wn}.
Obviously, the data is still not entirely clean, however one can at least identify, why several word-pairs are within $A$ or $B$ respectively. Applying the extracted data on sentences within \ac{SNLI} train, yields to an average of 44.6 samples from $A$ and 300.0 samples from $B$ for each single sentence, $p$ or $h$, for the helper-task.
\subsection{Evaluation}
We evaluate all previously explained experiments within this section.
\subsubsection{Integrate WordNet using embeddings}
Table \ref{tab:eval_embeddings_added} shows the performance of the concatenated word-embeddings together with the performance of the unchanged Residual-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\dagger$}. The upper part contains embeddings that have been newly created or changed to contain other than (only) distributional information, the lower part shows the concatenated hypernyms, using the original (but fine-tuned during training) distributional representations.

\caption{Evaluation of experiments with additional information in the word-representations, compared to the Residual-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\dagger$} (bottom).}
\label{tab:eval_embeddings_added}
\end{table}
All methods slightly decrease in terms of accuracy for the original \ac{SNLI} test set, even though only additional information are added. This however is not significant and most likely stems the parameters being highly tuned towards \ac{SNLI} for the original model. Since we do not intend to increase the performance by a small margin coming from hyperparameter settings, we did not fine-tune these parameters. Also on the new test set, most approaches do not show major differences to the original model. Only the concatenation of hypernyms with an increasing amount shows an improvement, which is even stronger than the accuracy achieved by \ac{ESIM} \citep{chen2017enhanced}.

\label{tab:mt_evaluation}
\end{table}
The first column shows the dimensions of the helper-task \ac{MLP}. We only used two layer \ac{MLP}s with relatively many dimensions, as previous experiments showed that smaller networks have already problems reaching a high accuracy of the helper-task. The presented networks all solve this task with an accuracy of $> 90 \%$ (dev). Similarily, we observe that, reducing  $\alpha$, thus increasing the impact of the helper-task, generally reduces the performance. This can be seen in the upper part of the table. Generally, reducing the impact of the helper-task, by increasing the complexity of the helper-task \ac{MLP}, omitting dropout or by increasing $\alpha$, the performance drops less (or slightly improves). Subsequentially, experiments with a very strong impact of the helper task, as sharing a layer of its \ac{MLP} or freezing its weights (third part of the table), reflect in a very poor performance. Similarily for the dynamic adaptions for $\alpha$ in the second part of the table only show comparable results to the original model, if the helper-task only is considered for a few iterations, with the model tuning to \ac{SNLI} in the begiinning and end of the training. By taking max-pooling information into account, the performance only decreases slightly. While this potentially should lay the focus on relevant words, we eglect the fact that certain attributes may be shifted, due to the context implementing nature of \ac{LSTM}s and indicated by the slight noisyness of dimensions. Thus, for ``a happy child'' the information for \textit{being happy} might not only be present within ``happy'', but also within ``child'', as the first describes the second word. This may result in ``child'' having a higher value within the relevant dimension. While this dimension may still be relatively high for ``happy'', in our experiment we neglect this dimension completely (by setting it to zero). Thus a more sophisticated approach might be to use the output vectors after each timestep for the according word directly, instead of masking the final sentence representation.
\newline

\noindent
Re-sampling the helper task such that $|A| = |B|$ seems superior to not-resampling. Not all evaluated models are completely comparable, as multiple parameters may differ. This is due to no findings with promising results, yielding in broadly covering experiments. Except for some small insignificant improvements on the new dataset, no experiment showed any success.

\subsection{Analysis}
We analyse selected experiments of both approaches, using concatenated emnbeddings or multitask-learning in this section, showing their strengths and disadvantages.

\caption{Accuracy per category for concatenated embeddings using Attract-Repel or Hyponyms-5.}
\label{tab:detail_added_embds}
\end{table}
Table \ref{tab:detail_added_embds} shows the accuracy per category for \texttt{Attract-Repel}, as being the most sophisticated word-representations additional non-distributional information and \texttt{Hypernyms-5}, as the best achieved result. Comparing the model with concatenated embeddings from Attract-Repel with Residual-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\dagger$} shows, that different features are considered relevant. Most of the differences within the categories seem arbitrary, arsing from this issue, as the original information would still be accessable to the model. Synonyms are strongly improved compared with the original model, which can easily be explained due to an even higher word-vector similarity from Attract-Repel post-processed representations. On the other hand, both antonym groups show no big improvement, the antonyms derived from WordNet show an even worse accuracy than before. Overall, the performance gained using these embeddings with all deviations within different categories is highly similar to the ones achieved using multitask learning (next Section). Since the added word-vectors encode differences for most antonyms, but do not leverage them, we assume this stems from a lack of representative data within \ac{SNLI} data. Naturally, if the model does not depend on those differences during training, it will not learn to consider them in the prediction process.

\paragraph*{Impact of hypernyms}
Looking at the concatenation of the mean of five hypernyms for each word, the increase in performance looks much more stable. Ignoring \textit{planets}, which are highly noise-sensitive due to their limited size, only two categories do not improve over the baseline. Note, that antonyms include word-pairs like ``day'' and ``night'' and hyperthetically may share the same hypernyms, as well as co-hyponyms do. Since, synonyms obviously also share similar hypernyms, the model must to learn this differentiation. Looking at the categorical evaluation, the performance of synonyms remains similar to the original evaluated model, showing that it does not suffer from added hypernyms in this aspect. Yet, we observe that adding hypernyms does not help in identifying synonyms, which is based on the results in Section ยง\ref{sec:additional_snli_set} a relatively easy do classify category. Especially the overall improvement for contradicting examples is interesting and we closer examine the impact of the hypernyms. To focus only on this aspect, in this anaysis we exclude samples, that are predicted identically as by the Residual-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\dagger$}. Even though the concatenated embeddings may have influenced those, too, we thus exclude samples that are correctly classified by memorizing word-relations form \ac{SNLI}.

	\label{fig:analyse_hypern5}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:analyse_hypern5} visualizes the impact of the hypernym embeddings by comparing how many hypernym embeddings are identicalw wor each word-pair($w_p$,$w_h$). In total, 1378 contradicting samples are classified differently from the original model, 984 are now classified correctly as contradiction (blue), 394 samples are now misclassified (red). The x-axis shows the percentage $x_{w_p,w_h}$ of shared hypernym lemmata between $w_p$ and $w_h$, calculated as 
\begin{equation}
x_{w_p,w_h} = \frac{|H_{w_p} \cap H_{w_h}|}{|H_{w_p} \cup H_{w_h}|}
\end{equation}
with $H_{w_p}$ and $H_{w_h}$ being the sets lemmata of hypernyms from $w_p$ and $w_h$ respectively, gathered using the same method as to create the embeddings. The y-axis displays the proportinal amount of each group. Contrarily to our intention, the model does not strongly use the additional vectors to identify co-hyponyms. Instead, especially if only few hypernyms are identical, more samples are re-predicted correctly, whereas a highr similarity of the hypernyms leads to a higher amount of incorrect predictions. unrelated words being an indicator for contradiction highly correlates with the data seen during training. Due to the creation process of \ac{SNLI} (in addtion to to frequently changed words as identified by \cite{gururangan2018annotation}) many contradicting samples describe very unrelated scenarios, yielding in contradiction based on the event-coreference, not because they contain related, but contradicting, words \citep{dasgupta2018evaluating}. Subsequentially, unrelatedness of words serves as a good indicator for contradiction. Yet, looking at different categories, we observe that at least for some of them, the model learned the tendency of leveraging from the added information in the intended way. Cardinals in general all share $\geq 0.7$ \% of their hypernym lemmata, thus are very similar to each other. A total of 200 cardinal samples are either in the red or blue group visualized. Of those, 143 (71.5\%) have been classified correctly with the concatenated hypernyms and only 57 (28.5\%) are misclassified compared to the original predictions. Similar, but less strongly, are 63 (61.8\%) countries with $\geq 0.7$\% shared hypernym lemmata classified correctly and only 39 (38.2\%) incorrectly. Opposed to these categories, for nationalities or antonyms, the improvements compared to the base model arises from unrelated word-pairs (in terms of their shared hypernym lemmata). In both cases, the majority of different re-prediction stems from word-pairs sharing no lemma within their hypernyms. Only looking at those word-pairs, sharing not a single word-vector for their hypernyms, 109 (88.6\%) of 123 nationalities\footnote{Other \textbf{mispredictions}: 2$\times$ with 0.8 shared, 3$\times$ with 0.3 shared. Other \textbf{correct} predictions: 5$\times$ with 0.1$-$0.5 shared, 16$\times$ with 0.7$-$0.9 shared} and 278 (90.3\%) of 308 antonyms\footnote{Other \textbf{mispredictions}: 52 $\times$ 0.5$-$0.9 shared. Other \textbf{correct} predictions: 5$\times$ with 0.2$-$0.5 shared, 41 with 0.5$-$0.9 shared.} are re-predicted correctly. In total, the model seems to slightly benefit from the added information in some cases in the intended way, in the majority of cases however, the improvement in performance seems to stem from another often occuring pattern in \ac{SNLI}, namely unrelated hypothesis, rather than improving the general \ac{NLU}. 

\subsubsection{Integrate WordNet using multitask-learning}
We select for the analysis the best performing model on the new test-set using a 300-dimensional helper task \ac{MLP} with $\alpha=0.75$ with re-sampling and dropout, denoted as \texttt{300D-0.75 STD} and the comparable model with with a stronger impact of the helper-task with $\alpha=0.5$, also 300 dimensions, resampling and dropout, named as \texttt{300D-0.5 STD}. Additionally we select the model using the max-pooled information, referred to as \texttt{300D-0.75 max-pool}, as it puts the focus on the actual word relations and performs comparably with the Residual-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\dagger$}. The accuracy per category of these models is displayed in Table \ref{tab:categories_mt}.

\caption{Accuracy per category for selected models using multitask-learning.}
\label{tab:categories_mt}
\end{table}
It can be seen that the majority of all contradicting categories performs worse than the base-model. Only the synonyms highly leverage from this method and assemble the performance, reached by attention-based models in Section ยง\ref{sec:additional_snli_set}. We observe this effect on synonyms for all 17 evaluated models of Section ยง\ref{sec:eval_mt}. The extracted synonyms from WordNet are much less noisy than co-hyponyms, which may lead to the interpretation, that the helper-task is more likely to consider the relevant dimensions coming from the synonym for its prediction. However, as seen by the model, taking max-pooling information into account, the performance on contradicting samples is still very poor. Only two categories seem to be improved on a relatively constant basis. Cardinals improve in 7/17 approaches, mostly by more 10 ten points in accuracy, vegetables improve on 9/17 approaches, with a maximum of 9.1\% increase. Especially the drop within the second model for countries is severe, yet not only present within this model. Not a single model of our evaluations superceeded the original model for countries, 8/16 decreaed by more than 35 points in accuracy, another 2 by more than 10 points. Since the other models of Section ยง\ref{sec:additional_snli_set} achieve similar results, and Residual-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\dagger$} is highly aligned with its hyperparameters to Residual-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\Diamond$}, we assume the high performance arises from correctly picked features by chance, rather than stemming from the model's architecture. 

\paragraph*{Impact of the selected data}
Due to our restricted word-pair extraction method, defined in Section ยง\ref{sec:used_wordnet_extract_strategy}, the upper bound, that can be achieved using this information drops. Thus, in the following analysis we only look at samples, that could have been classified correctly, based on the extracted data from WordNet. The results are depicted in Table \ref{tab:eval_mt_data}. We report the absoolute amount of samples together with the percentage of the original size of each category. The categories drinks (3), vegetables (11), planets (20), materials (35) and planets (37) are aggregated due to insufficient amount of samples to derive any representative conclusions. All $\Delta$ show the difference to the Residual-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\dagger$} on the same data, instead of comparing them with the same model using the full data.

\caption{Accuracy per category of three selected multitask-learning experiments compared with Residual-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\dagger$} on samples covered by extracted word-pairs.}
\label{tab:eval_mt_data}
\end{table}
The 100\% accuracy is not very suprising, given the fact that only synonym examples are included, if they can be explained using the extracted data. Thus, samples of this category that have another label than entailment, due to the usage in context, are excluded. Ther performance gain in the aggegated \textit{other} category mostly stems from materials. Even though the models perform higher on some categories, compared to the performance over all data, except for cardinals and synonyms, all are generally predicted worse than by the base model without multitask-learning. If we compare the overall performance of each model with the performance achieved over all data, we observe that only the original Residual-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\dagger$} improved in accuracy, while other models perform worse than before. Subsequentially, they perform slightly better on the other half of the data, that cannot be explained using the fused information. \cite{chen2017natural} show with \ac{KIM} extracted a total of 5,425,426 word pairs\footnote{Note, that they have a align words of $p$ and $h$ to identify their relation, thus they may not suffer that much from arbitrary word relations, extracted from WordNet.}, being crucially more than ours (686,265), that the network especially levergaes from those, if $\geq$ 40\% of the external knowledge is used. Compared too that, our experiments may indeed suffer from limited coverage, especially since \cite{chen2017natural} directly encode the lexical relations and we still rely on the \ac{MLP} to leverage from them, indirectly encoded within the sentence-representation. Yet, it could have been expected, that models would have an advantage on this subset of data. Since they obviously fail to take advantage of the fused information, sufficient for all those samples, the problem seems to rather be the method than the data.

\paragraph*{Impact on the sentence representation}
Looking back to the original intention, of fine-tuning embeddings and esuring those differences would be present within the sentence-representation, we take a closer look at this aspect. Following the results from the previous step we can only see, that the multitask-learning is not heelpful for the final prediction, which can have several reasons: Either the helper-task did not manage to encode the relevant differences into the sentence-representation, or it did, but the model failed to take advntage of them. We us the same technique as introduced in Section ยง\ref{sec:approach_general_alignment_understanding}, visualizing the alignment of the sentence-representations of $p$ and $h$. To only focus on samples with the required knowledge fused, we only calculate the averaged counts for the same subset of the data from the previous section, but only looking at contradicting samples (3511).
\begin{figure}[tph!]
\centering
	\includegraphics[totalheight=7cm]{fig/base_correct_incorrect_c.png}
	\caption{Aligned $p$ and $h$ for all contradicting sampes, covered by the fused WordNet information, correctly predicted (left) or mis-predicted (right).}
	\label{fig:base_correct_incorrect_c}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:base_correct_incorrect_c} shows the aligned sentences for the original Residual-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\dagger$}, differentiating between the 1954 correctly classified samples and 1557 mis-classified samples. As expected the majority of dimensions have the same value, arising from the high lexical overlap and the fact that word-pairs are selecterd to be replacable in context, thus will have similar embeddings. Even though the network structure, dimensions and performance, compared to the analysed model Shortcut-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\dagger$}, slightly changed, the results gained from this section still seem applicable. Due to the similarity of both sentences, only few dimensions differ. Taking this into consideration we observe that more of these differing dimensions for the correctly classified samples, in many cases morw than twice the amount of differeing dimensions compared to the misclassified examples. Knowing that the Residual-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\dagger$} most likely follows the same principles as identfified in Section ยง\ref{sec:understanding}, we now look at the sentence-representations gained from multitasking (for the same data). Figure \ref{fig:300d75_correct_incorrect_c} shows the aligned sentence-representations (correct and mis-predicted) for the best multitask-learned model \textit{300D-0.75 ST}.
\begin{figure}[tph!]
\centering
	\includegraphics[totalheight=7cm]{fig/300d75_correct_incorrect_c.png}

	\label{fig:300d75_correct_incorrect_c}
\end{figure}
Comparing these visuaizations with the orignal model, clearly both, the mispredicted and correctly predicted sentence-representations show a higher amount of different high-valued dimensions. In line with our other observations, this is especially visible for the correctly classified samples. While the Residual-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\dagger$}, as well as the Shortcut-Stacked Encoder\textsuperscript{$\dagger$} showed the majotity of dimensions within the positive values area, in this case a huge amount of samples are also within the negative area. We do not start another dimension-wise analysis for this model and leave it open for interpretation. Since this phenomen stems from the helper-task, one possible explanation is, that low values indicate the absence of specific words. Having a large lexical overlap, $p$ and $h$ lack the same words from $B$ for the majority of words, thus the dominant symmetry for the negative values may arise. Even though the main-task may still optimize to deal with negative values or interpret the absence of information not aligned with zero but another value, this breaks the same behaviour that was naturally learned by both models without multitask-learning Similarily, XX showed, that even though the model are able to learn element-wise difference and product (which both work intuitively well with absence of information being encoded close to zero) by themselves, using it in the feature concatenation helps the performance. Yet, we do not further investiate this phenomena and it may not even be harmful to the final prediction. Similar results are shown for the other two experiments, picked for the analysis part\footnote{We did not conduct similar analysis for the remaining models.}. Figure \ref{masking_e_c} shows all contradicting and entailing samples of the selected data, regardless of their prediction of the model, encoded by \textit{300D-0.75 max-pool}.
\begin{figure}[tph!]

	\label{fig:masking_e_c}
\end{figure}
This seems to be a bit more fuzzy, compared to the other two multi-tasking experiments. Neglecting the high amount of negative valued dimensions, this is exctly the kind of representations we were aiming for, clearly encoding the same information fr entailing examples, while also encoding differences for the contradicting samples. As seen in Section ยง\ref{sec:understanding_align_neutral_contr}, this however is not sufficient for the model to predict contradiction, as distinct information is also present for neutral samples. We conclude, that we managed to shift the sentence-representation in a way, that it encodes differences for antonyms and co-hyponyms stronger than before. However the classifying \ac{MLP} lacks to leverage from those in the intended way. The many negative valued dimensions may also indicate, that the helper-task and the main task put more emphasis on different dimensions.
\subsection{Summarizing experiments to incorporate WordNet}
We encountered the challenge of gaining high quality data out of WordNet. Even though lexical resources contain a huge amount of information, it is requred to put more effort into the extraction of the data. In our case, we applied a simple strategy to increase the precision of the exracted data, yet at the expense of a lot of valuable information. We have shown, that adding additional information to the network inputs (the embeddings) may have a good impact in some cases, however we still rely on the train data to rely on those additional information and the model to identify and consider them as relevant features. This is somewhat challenging, since some of these information might be less frequent in the data, while highly represented arbitrary patterns within the train data are more important w.r.t. the optimmization function. We tackled this problem using multitask-learning and have successfully transferred word similarities based on the fused WordNet information into the sentence-representation, yet the final \ac{MLP} failed to consider them in the desired way. This basically breaks down to the same problem, that the changed encodings are not considered relevant w.r.t. the train data.
\paragraph*{Comparing to \ac{KIM}}
As opposed to the sentence-encoding Residual-Stacked Encoder, \ac{KIM} \citep{chen-EtAl:2017b:natural} uses inter-sentence attention and identifies directly the WordNet relation for words within $p$ and $h$, while we only use a indirect way to encode this. Theit approach however seems very elegant, if considering the heavy influence of the train data, whether features are considered relevant or not. \cite{gururangan2018annotation} identified the \ac{SNLI}-specific patterns not as a problem because they are incorrect, but because they are highly dominant, leading to oversimplified solutions only based on those. Thus, a model has a good chance of being correct to classify a sample as contradicting if a ``cat'' is in the $h$ and a ``dog'' is in $p$, which is not challenging to learn for a neural network if seen in a large number of times. However, instead of memorizing this specific word-pair, knowing that both words are close hyponyms of the same hypernym (``pet'') also serves a simple and effective feature. By assigning each lexical relation (quantified by their distance) holding between two words, onto one specific dimension, \cite{chen-EtAl:2017b:natural} made this simple feature easily accessable and also show that especially the information for co-hyponomy is beneficial. Subsequentially to having this \textit{meaningful} decision criteria, the model can apply the same strategy on other co-hyponyms and indeed achieve a better generalization ability. As opposed to their strategy, using the indirectd way to encode differences still relied on the importance of those difference for the train data. Even if the same lexical relation can be inferred from those new representations (which would be the best case, but most likely is not the case), this may depend on different dimensions, depending on the actual words. We conclude that WordNet information must be fused in a way, that is generally applicable and can easily be identified by the model, in order to overcome certain patterns and be more useful than memorizing.
